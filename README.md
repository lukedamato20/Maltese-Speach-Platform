# Maltese-Speach-Platform

The task will focus on creating an online-accessible platform that provides access to two speech systems for Maltese:

- Automatic speech recognition - the ASR engine (MASRI) will need to be packaged in a standalone system, accessible via web requests, allowing users to submit voice queries and
receiving a transcription.
- Text to Speech - the TTS engine will allow users to submit correctly written Maltese text, and receive a synthesised version of the output. As in the case of ASR, the engine itself will need to be packaged to service web requests.


These two services will be made accessible via web browsers, as well as via mobile phone app access, acting as a frontend to the same web service. Moreover, the TTS system can be
integrated through an application plugin to include the service within an application such as a word processor.
